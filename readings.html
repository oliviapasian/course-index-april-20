<h2>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h2>
</div>

<br>

<div id="textchunk1">
   <p>The two readings were from<a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/06/github-microsoft-open-source-code-technology"> Jacobin Magazine</a> and the<a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/the-programmed-designer"> Eye Magazine</a>. The two questions we answered regarding the articles were:
   </p>
   <p> "1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other?" </p>
       
   <p>"2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?"</p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk2">
    <p>Here is my response to these readings:</p>
    <p>1. For the article by Eye Magazine, I believe the stance of the author is that Apple and Adobe have too much hold over the practice of design and designers should consider a more independent design practice. I think the author is promoting using open-source software and generally re-considering how we use our "tools". I think this particular sentence from the article summarizes the authors position: "Uniform dependence on these products commodifies the activity of design itself." The other article, from Jacobin, is focused on coding and the author's position is very pro-open source code and they believe a democratically organized tech centre would be good for the future of coding. Both articles are focused on ways to stray from capitalism and over-powered corporations as well as moving towards sharing skills and ideas with open source software and code. I think the solutions suggested in both articles are similar, but I think the Eye Magazine one is more about being independent while the Jacobin Magazine one suggests more of a group effort. However, the ideas of supporting open source and not sticking with the forced industry-standard are present in both articles and are pertinent to each-other. </p>

    <p> 2. I think typography and type-setting is really important. That's a bit obvious but I think being able to do it by hand as well and not relying on a single digital tool is important. Learning about it as a practice and being able to apply it in many different ways in design is important. Also, for me, I think illustration skills are integral to my personal design practice. Being able to use those skills with design is important to my practice and I think it offers different perspectives and opportunities with graphic design.</p>

    <h2>Reading Discussion II: Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...
    </h2>
</div>

<div id="textchunk4">
    <p>For this discussion, the two readings were Olia Lialina's<a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/"> Turing Complete User</a> and Laurel Schwulst's<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/"> My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</a> </p>
<p>The two questions we were responding to were:</p>
<p>"1. What do you think of Lialina's definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. </p>
<p>"2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst)."</p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk5">
    <p>Here was my response:</p>
    <p>1. I think it is an interesting idea and a useful category for understanding Schwulst's argument. Both are talking about independence as a user of the web and I think that Lialina's discussion of how Univeral Users make their own way of doing things really ties in with Schwulst saying websites can be what we want them to be. "Sometimes it is a conscious choice not to delegate particular jobs to the computer, and sometimes it is just a habit." I think this quote in particular really goes well with what Schwulst says here: "...the internet is made up of individual nodes: individual computers talking to other individual computers." Lialina's comment on how Univeral Users are all of us to some degree as there is always individuality in computer users makes Schwulst's argument make more sense: it is human nature to want to create our own space on the internet as opposed to being stuck using a platform where everything is decided for us.</p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk6">
    <p>2. I think I might be an Invisible User. I don't usually question the decisions my computer makes for me and I usually like shortcuts. But the ideas about designers being encouraged to be excited about not having to do the "grunt work" and only having to do the "creative" work ("The less you think about source code, scripts, links and the web itself, the more creative you are as a web designer") really resonated with me because I find coding really interesting and I think this part of Lialina's text reminded me what I like about design, which is being able to do all of it. I still think it sometimes is nice to be able to accomplish things quickly with Adobe shortcuts but this text reminded me that doing all the work and having control over every part of something is also something great in design.</p>

    <h2>Reading Discussion III: Code, letters, logic, play
    </h2>
</div>

<div id="textchunk7">
    <p>For this discussion, the reading was Peter Biľak's<a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_importance_of_play"> The Importance of Play</a> and we also were asked to watch Just van Rossum and Type@Cooper's<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">  Math, Logic, Design?</a> </p>
<p>The discussion prompt I chose to respond to was:</p>
<p>"1. A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature." </p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk8">
    <p>Here was my response:</p>
    <p>Responding to the first prompt, I think an example of a pattern in nature that is programmatic in nature is a snowflake. Snowflakes form when a very cold water droplet freezes on to a dust or pollen particle, forming an ice crystal. As it falls, water vapour falls onto the ice and builds new crystals that make up the arms of the snowflake. The six arms are symmetrical because of something to do with the water molecules in the crystal and how the ice builds up into the arms because the spaces are predetermined by the internal order of the molecules. The temperature of the air is what creates different styles of snowflakes. I just learned all of that from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, I'll add the link at the bottom, but I think it is a programmatic phenomenon. Snowflakes build up from a central point, similar to how we start with blank index.html, style.css, and/or sketch.js files and fill it in as we go to create visuals. The crystal arms of the snowflake rely on each-other to keep building upwards, you need the base and arms to build before anything else works, which is similar to how every small part of code needs to be correct or it won't work quite right. 
    </p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk9">
    <p>And the ability for snowflakes to start with the simple idea of cold water freezing onto a particle and build endless varieties of patterns is similar to how with code, we all use the same languages but there are endless ways to create visuals. </p>

    <h2>Reading Discussion IV:  In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl
    </h2>
</div>

<div id="textchunk10">
    <p>For this discussion, the reading was Hito Steyerl's<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/24/67860/in-free-fall-a-thought-experiment-on-vertical-perspective/"> In Free Fall</a>. </p>
<p>The discussion prompt I chose to respond to was:</p>
<p>"1. A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment." </p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk11">
    <p>Here was my response:</p>
    <p>Responding to the first prompt:

        I would define surveillance as being watched. I think Steyerl is saying how with all these new ways of viewing from above like drones and satellites, it has become normalized to be constantly watched. Steyerl goes through the history of different perspectives and their development and eventually lands on how we now have things like Google Earth creating aerial map views. We also have drones and satellites all over the place in the sky and so many different reasons for organizations to want to use aerial technology to surveil. Methods of aerial data collection have become so normalized to us because things like Google Earth can be helpful. I feel like it was introduced slowly to us, as drones didn't just appear overnight, and I think we have become so comfortable with it all because it was marketed as being beneficial and just a harmless tool. So now we have this culture of surveillance where we're all okay with it but if you think about it a bit, it becomes pretty creepy. 
    </p>
</div>

<div id="textchunk12">
    <p>Steyerl sums my thoughts up here: "...new technologies have enabled the detached observant gaze to become ever more inclusive and all-knowing to the point of becoming massively intrusive—as militaristic as it is pornographic, as intense as extensive, both micro- and macroscopic". </p>
